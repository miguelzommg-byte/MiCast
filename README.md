A fully featured free and open-source implementation of AirPlay for Android that turns your device into an AirPlay-compatible display and speaker, based on [UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay).

## Features

- Screen mirroring with H.264 and H.265 (HEVC) video decoding
- Audio streaming with AAC-ELD, AAC-LC and ALAC audio decoding
- Music streaming with track information, cover art, and playback controls
- Support for Picture-in-Picture, automatic resolution and mode switching
- Optional PIN authentication
- Video resolution, overscan, and frame rate control
- Audio latency control and support for software decoder fallback
- Debug overlay with real-time statistics (FPS, bitrate, codec, resolution, frame count, audio volume, etc.)
- Android native media session integration with notification controls

> [!WARNING]
> DRM content (e.g. from the Apple TV application) is not supported.

## Compatibility

- Android 8.0+
- Devices on the same subnet

## Implementation

This application uses the C-based [UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay) library to implement the AirPlay/RAOP protocol, with a JNI bridge to the Android application layer. Audio is decoded via Android MediaCodec (AAC) or the Apple ALAC decoder (software fallback). Video is decoded via MediaCodec and rendered to a SurfaceView.

    AppleDevice["Apple Device (Sender)"]
    UxPlay["UxPlay (C/JNI)<br/>RAOP + mDNS<br/>FairPlay"]
    AndroidApp["Android (Receiver)<br/>MediaCodec + AudioTrack"]

    AppleDevice -- "RAOP" --> UxPlay
    UxPlay --> AndroidApp
```

CMake is used for native C/C++ components under [`app/src/main/cpp`](app/src/main/cpp). Submodules must be initialized before building. 

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Check out the [CI](https://github.com/jqssun/android-airplay-server/blob/main/.github/workflows/apk.yml) for more details on reproducible builds.
